Dear experts, scholars and related practitioners:ï¼š

This is our code for new algorithm called LDRN, which is proposed to solve the super-resolution problem.

We have given our model here, which can be used to verify our results.
However, due to github restrictions, we saved the test datasets on OneDrive. You can download the test datasets from the following URL: 

https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsnHFFsP0cnXkDl82thlis6dXlLT?e=JTo3BC

Unzip the datasets and copy them to the root directory. Then, you can run  test.py to generate super-resolution results.
If you want to train our model by yourself, please download the training data set yourself and run main.py.

All of our experiments were conducted using Pytorch1.7 on a NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU.
