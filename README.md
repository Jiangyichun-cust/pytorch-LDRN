Lightweight Dual-stream ResidualNetwork for Single ImageSuper-Resolution

Hello! This is my code for new algorithm called LDRN. This is proposed to solve the super-resolution problem. 

We have given our model here, which can be used to verify our results.
However, due to github restrictions, we saved the test datasets on OneDrive. You can download the test datasets from the following URL:

Unzip the datasets and copy them to the root directory. Then, you can run main.py to train our proposed model.Finally, running test.py to generate super-resolution results.
